<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
The <em>r.futures.demand</em> module of FUTURES
determines the quantity of expected land changed.
It creates a demand table as the number of cells to be converted
at each time step for each subregion based on the relation
between the population and developed land in the past years.

<p>
The input  accepts multiple (at least 2)
rasters of developed (category 1) and undeveloped areas (category 0)
from different years, ordered by time.
For these years, user has to provide the population numbers for each subregion
in parameter <b>observed_population</b> as a CSV file.
The format is as follows. First column is time
(matching the time of rasters used in parameter <b>development</b>) and
first row is the category of the subregion. The separator can be set
with parameter <b>separator</b>.
<pre>
year	1	2	...
1985	19860	10980	...
1995	20760	12660	...
2005	21070	13090	...
2015	22000	13940	...
</pre>
<p>
The same table is needed for projected population
(parameter <b>projected_population</b>).
The categories of the input raster <b>subregions</b> must
match the identifiers of subregions in files given in <b>observed_population</b>
and <b>projected_population</b>.
Parameter <b>simulation_times</b> is a comma separated list
of times for which the demand will be computed. The first time should
be the time of the developed/undeveloped raster used
in <em><a href="r.futures.pga.html">r.futures.pga</a></em>
as a starting point for simulation. There is an easy way to create
such list using Python:
<pre>
','.join([str(i) for i in range(2015, 2031)])
</pre>
or Bash:
<pre>
seq -s, 2015 2030
</pre>

<p>
The <b>method</b> parameter allows to choose the type of relation
between population and developed area. The available methods
include linear, logarithmic and exponential relation.
If more than one method is checked, the best relation is selected
based on RMSE. Recommended methods are logarithmic or linear.

<p>
The format of the output <b>demand</b> table is:
<pre>
year	1	2	...
2016	2900	243	...
2017	2790	240	...
2018	2660	232	...
2019	2345	221	...
2020	2154	215	...
...
</pre>
where each value represents the number of new developed cells in each step.
In case the demand values would be negative (in case of population decrease
or if the relation is inversely proportional) the values are turned into zeros,
since FUTURES does not simulate change from developed to undeveloped sites.
By changing the "Years_to_simulate" number, user can control the simulation.

<p>
An optional output <b>plot</b> is a plot of the relations for each subregion.
It allows to more effectively assess the relation suitable for each subregion.
Format of the file is determined from the extension and can be for example PNG, PDF, SVG.

<h2>NOTES</h2>
<em>r.futures.demand</em> computes the relation
between population and developed area using simple
regression. It therefore serves as starting point
for demand computation which can be further improved.
